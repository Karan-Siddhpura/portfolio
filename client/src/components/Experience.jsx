            <b> Project Name - NYCERS</b> <br /> In the NYCERS project, I worked
            as a Manual Tester, where I was responsible for creating detailed
            test cases to ensure the functionality and quality of the
            application on the Salesforce platform as well as other client
            websites. I collaborated closely with both onshore and offshore
            teams, along with developers, to understand the project requirements
            thoroughly and ensure effective testing.

          <p>
            <b>Project Name - Solaire Boutique</b> <br />I excel at
            understanding client requirements and translating them into dynamic,
            responsive web applications that prioritize both user experience and
            performance. Integrating API calls to dynamically fetch and display
            data, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.
            <br />
            <b>Project Name - Vijay Sales</b> <br /> I worked on the Vijay Sales
            project, leading a POC for server-side rendering (SSR) with React.js
            and Adobe Commerce, optimizing reusable components to enhance
            performance and SEO. Alongside frontend tasks, I contributed as a
            backend developer, creating custom configurations, extending Adobe
            Commerce functionality, and developing REST endpoints and GraphQL
            APIs for seamless frontend-backend communication. Visiting the
            clientâ€™s site allowed me to refine the project based on real-time
            feedback, strengthening collaboration. This project gave me the
            chance to work across the full stack, applying both frontend and
            backend expertise.
